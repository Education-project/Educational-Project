“Why law?” It’s the question every would-be law student dreads
Why law? That’s a question you’re going to be asked over and over again if you are starting to think a career in law might be the one for you. You’ll be answering it on work placement application forms, during training interviews, at tutor meetings, when applying for courses, at scholarship interviews... the list goes on.
So, if you are at school or college and thinking about a career in law, it’s a good idea to start considering how you’re going to answer it. And not just because you’d look stupid if you fluffed it. Once you’ve worked out “why law”, you will find you can apply yourself to the process of achieving your goal in a more focused, determined and disciplined manner.
“Come on, the question seems simple enough. What’s the fuss?”
When you’re filling out application forms, you need to be structured and logical in your answers. A personal question - “why law?” - can feel somehow unexpected and can be very off-putting. It is easy to get into a muddle if you have not thought it through.
The first time I answered this question, I was applying for an apprenticeship and had little legal experience. I wrote: “Law, being a vital component in the successfull integration of people, impresses me with its in-built readiness to change in accordance with society. The long-standing legal system in this country and the relationship between Parliament and the courts provide a dynamic professional environment within which to work”.
Although I had worked hard at my answer and showed that I knew a little about the legal system, I had not thought carefully enough about why I personally was intending to pursue a career in law. My answer was not a convincing enough argument and I was unsuccessful as a result.
“Ok! Just tell me what I need to say...”
Many different kinds of people succeed at the law, and the best answer really will depend on your personality.
Consider carefully your own reasons and source of motivation. We may agree with Aristotle that “the law is reason free from passion”, yet an answer as to why you might want a career in law is the opposite - it is a rare opportunity to show your passion, so do not be afraid to. It will help you stand out next to someone else, and an interviewer may well remember you by it.
There are some characteristics that your interviewers, tutors and employers will be expecting from you straight away, such as how good you might be with clients, how much commercial awareness you have, and what characteristics you can bring to a role. Work experience helps prove you are competent in these areas, and leaves you with a wealth of examples to talk about on application forms and during interviews.
So, before I leave you to mull over your answer to “why law?”, here are three useful tips to improve your chances getting work experience:
I. Write a tailored letter, targeting a specific person in a firm.
2. Try requesting one to two days, not two weeks, as you are more likely to gain shorter placements than longer ones.
3. Make sure you write a thank you letter ~ it is a good way for you to be remembered positively, in case you want to go back.
