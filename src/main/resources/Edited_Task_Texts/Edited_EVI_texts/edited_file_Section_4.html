Too Many Prisoners, Too Few Staff - Why Our Prisons Are in Crisis
Our prisons are in crisis - violence, self-harm and deaths in custody are at all-time high, prison capacity is stretched way beyond its limits and far too few prison officers struggle <div class = 'down'><b>17</b><input id = 'i17'class ='sel_answer' type ='text' disabled name='answer' size='5'></div>. Against this backdrop, the Government has published its long-awaited Prisons and Courts Bill. They now accept <div class = 'down'><b>18</b><input id = 'i18'class ='sel_answer' type ='text' disabled name='answer' size='5'></div>; they must be places of education, rehabilitation and reform.

The latest figures again show <div class = 'down'><b>19</b><input id = 'i19'class ='sel_answer' type ='text' disabled name='answer' size='5'></div> in Western Europe. Prisons are massively overcrowded, while chronic staff shortages mean staff cannot even ensure safety.
